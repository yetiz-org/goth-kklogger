# KKLogger Configuration Example
# Copy this file to logger.yaml and modify as needed

logger:
  # Log file directory path
  logger_path: "alloc/logs/"
  
  # Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error
  log_level: "trace"
  
  # Enable asynchronous writing for better performance
  async_write: true
  
  # Include caller information in logs
  report_caller: true
  
  # Environment identifier
  environment: "default"
  
  # Archive configuration (optional)
  # Archive is automatically enabled when max_size_bytes > 0 or rotation_interval is set
  archive:
    # Archive when file reaches this size (bytes)
    # Example: 10485760 = 10MB, 104857600 = 100MB
    max_size_bytes: 10485760
    
    # Rotate log at aligned time intervals
    # The rotation happens at time boundaries (e.g., "24h" = daily at 00:00, "1h" = hourly at :00)
    # Go duration format supports: ns, us, ms, s, m, h
    # Examples: "1h" (hourly at :00), "24h" (daily at 00:00), "168h" (weekly)
    # Note: Go does NOT support 'd' for days, use hours instead (24h = 1 day)
    rotation_interval: "24h"
    
    # Directory name for archived files (relative to logger_path)
    archive_dir: "archived"
    
    # Filename pattern for archived files (Go time format)
    # Default: "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00" (RFC3339)
    # Custom: "2006-01-02_15-04-05" (no colons for Windows compatibility)
    filename_pattern: "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
    
    # Compression type: "gzip" or "none"
    compression: "gzip"
